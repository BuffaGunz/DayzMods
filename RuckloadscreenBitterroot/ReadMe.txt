Loading Screen template,
I recommend the png size to be 2560px X 1440px before converting to .edds 

1. In data Replace the Ruckloadscreen.edds with your .edds  

2. Simply change the name of Ruckloadscreen to whatever you want call your pbo.(Main Folder)

3. In Scripts\3_Game\ModdedDayZGame.c Change the name of Ruckloadscreen and Ruckloadscreen.edds on line 8,55,66. (To Your Pbo name and your .edds name)

4. In config.cpp change the name of Ruckloadscreen on line 46. (To Your Pbo name)

5.Pack in addons builder, sign and upload to your mod or server pack.
Enjoy 



(In the scripts 5_mission there are 2 files you can edit MainMenu.c change the text you to whatever you want displayed this replaces the modded warning. in the InGameMenu.c right down the bottom you can again change the modded warning text. There is also a discord link you change, this replaces the feedback button with a discord button in the pause screen. For whatever reason this breaks the count down display when logging out (cant see the digits) havnt looked into it what is causing it not a big deal to me.)
